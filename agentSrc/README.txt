The classes in this directory are not used by the Google App Engine application 
or eclipse directly.  The classes stored here are test classes to show the 
operation of the ClassLoader.  They are compiled using the ant tasks stored in
build.xml, which will compile them then bundle them into jars that can be 
uploaded into the application using the form in index.jsp.
